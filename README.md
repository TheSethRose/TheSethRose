# 👋 Hi, I'm Seth Rose

I'm a software developer, entrepreneur, and passionate advocate for neurodiversity. My journey has been one of resilience, determination, and an unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in the world of technology.

## 🧠 Neurodiversity Advocacy

As a neurodivergent individual, I deeply understand the challenges and unique perspectives that come with neurodiversity. It is my life's mission to embrace the strengths of the neurodiverse community and create technology that helps us overcome challenges, fostering innovation, creativity, and problem-solving in ways that might otherwise be overlooked.

## 🔭 Current Projects

- **Time Capsule**: An open-source, self-hosted AI assistant that empowers users with perfect memory by continuously capturing and storing digital activities, including screen recordings and typed text. It enables instant search and retrieval of any information seen or typed on the device.

- **Jupyter Notebook to Markdown Converter**: A Python script that converts Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) to Markdown format (.md), combines all converted files into a single file, and provides options to delete original files and subdirectories.

- **Upcoming Open Source Projects**: I have several exciting open source projects in the pipeline that leverage LLMs in unique and creative ways to enhance efficiency and drive innovation. Stay tuned! 😉

I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. My top current interests are...

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Learning about artificial intelligence and its potential of harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of what's possible.

- **Web Development**: Enhancing my skills in modern web technologies to create engaging and interactive user experiences.
