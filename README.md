# üëã Hi, I'm Seth!

As a neurodivergent software developer, entrepreneur, and passionate advocate for the neurodiverse community, you'll likely find me on ùïè (Twitter), discussing the latest advancements in AI, machine learning, and their potential to revolutionize industries. 

My secret weapons are my ADHD-fueled brain, a steady stream of caffeine, and an undying love for solving problems that make mere mortals cry. 

When I'm not battling corporate inefficiencies or integrating systems that were never meant to talk to each other, I'm probably sharpening my skills in full stack development & #buildinpublic - because why not add a few more programming languages to the mix?

As a proud cancer survivor in remission from Stage 4 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma since February 27, 2024, I've learned invaluable lessons about resilience, self-advocacy, and the importance of prioritizing mental and physical well-being. 

## üî≠ Current Projects & Focus

- **ServiceNow Development**: With extensive experience as a Senior ServiceNow Developer, I specialize in enhancing organizational efficiency and streamlining processes within the ServiceNow platform. My technical mastery spans across various domains, including ITSM, SecOps, CSM, and HR services.

- **Personal Website**: I'm currently working on revamping my personal website, [sethrose.dev](http://www.sethrose.dev), to run on GitHub Pages. This platform will serve as a central hub for showcasing my projects, sharing insights, and engaging with the tech community.

- **Creative AI Applications**: I'm fascinated by the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in driving innovation and efficiency through creative software solutions. I'm actively exploring and developing projects that leverage these cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of what's possible.

- **Time Capsule**: An open-source, self-hosted AI assistant that empowers users with perfect memory by continuously capturing and storing digital activities, including screen recordings and typed text. It enables instant search and retrieval of any information seen or typed on the device.

- **Upcoming Open Source Projects**: I have several exciting open source projects in the pipeline that leverage LLMs in unique and creative ways to enhance efficiency and drive innovation. Stay tuned for updates on these cutting-edge developments!
